      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
        Hello, I'm Alicia Wilson (formerly and sometimes still Alicia Noble). I am a Cheyenne, Wyoming native. I grew up on sports; first soccer, then softball, volleyball, basketball, and track. Sport's mainly taught me that failure leads to success and perfection is non-existent. I learned to persevere when things became difficult, to work with others to achieve goals, and how to fail gracefully in front of teammates and spectators.<br>
        <br>
        A love for animals helped me to develop an interest in the sciences in school. In the classes and skills that built a strong science background, math classes and abilities always seemed to tag along. As a college freshman I entered school planning to be a chemical engineer. Problem was, I didn't like my engineering classes or my chemistry classes. I didn't want my first year of school to be a waste, so the only other thing I had credits in was Math. So, I went for math. But I didn't think there was much application to a math degree, so I tacked an education degree on with it. I've since learned that, teaching isn't something that you just fall into. Teachers have to absolutely love everything about childcare, psychology, and humanities to be effective. While attempting to further my abilities as a teacher through a masters program; I stumbled upon coding. Which, I discovered was basically teaching advanced math to a computer. Not only does it fit my personality/interests, but it's also in high demand. So now I'm an Array student, ready to learn to code and take on the world of technology.
